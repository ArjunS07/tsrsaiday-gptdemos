      <p> 
        This site is powered by a language model called <b> GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3). </b>
        A language model is a machine learning model that is used to predict the next word in a sequence of words. Language models are trained on large amounts of text data, and the predictions they make can be used to generate new text or to understand the context of a piece of text.
        GPT-3 is a language model that was trained on a dataset of over one billion words. The dataset includes a wide variety of texts, including books, articles, and websites. 
        
        <br> <br> 
        GPT-3 is better than its predecessor, GPT-2, and other language models, in several ways: it has a larger training set, it uses more sophisticated methods to make predictions, and it can handle longer sequences of words.
      The potential weak points of GPT-3 include its reliance on statistical methods (which can be biased), its lack of understanding of grammar and syntax (which can lead to errors in prediction), and its limited vocabulary (which may limit its ability to generate new text).
        
        <br> <br>

        <em> 
          The description of GPT-3 that you just read was in itself written by GPT-3.

          This website was coded using the Flask framework for Python by Arjun Sharma.
